## Cleaning And Transforming Dutch Horse Racing Data (Written In RMarkdown) 
I have downloaded a lot of dutch harness racing results from [ndr.nl](https://ndr.nl/) with a script written in python (see [here](https://github.com/chris-alex-p/draf-ndr-scraper)). 
Now the goal is to take a closer look at the data: Filtering out faulty data and making useful transfomations to make a further analysis easier.  

## Usage
Just use the clean_transform.Rmd file with RStudio in combination with the data-folder (that contains the previously downloaded data). 
Or you could just take a look at the whole thing in github via the clean_transform.md file.
